## Features List
- `add_department`: This routine is used to add a new department. The inputs to the routine are:
    - Department ID
    - Department ame
2. remove_department: This routine is used to remove a department. The inputs to the routine should minimally
include:
Department ID
When a department is removed, we assume that all employees belonging to that department have been either (1)
transferred to other department or (2) removed.
3. add_room: This routine is used to add a new room. The inputs to the routine should minimally include:
Floor number
Room number
Room name
Room capacity
Note that for simplicity, we never remove a room.
4. change_capacity: This routine is used to change the capacity of the room. The inputs to the routine should
minimally include:
Floor number
Room number
Capacity
Date
The date is assumed to be today but is given as part of the input for simplicity.
5. add_employee: This routine is used to add a new employee. The inputs to the routine should minimally include:
Employee name
Employee contact number
Kind (junior, senior or manager)
Employee department
The unique employee ID and email address are automatically generated by the system.
6. remove_employee: This routine is used to remove an employee. The inputs to the routine should minimally include:
Employee ID
Date (i.e., the last day of work, assumed to be in the past or today)
Note that all past records should be kept intact while all future records should be removed in accordance with the
specification.
